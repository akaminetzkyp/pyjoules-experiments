# pyjoules-experiments

Two models were used for these final experiments: [cifar10-fast](https://github.com/davidcpage/cifar10-fast/tree/d31ad8d393dd75147b65f261dbf78670a97e48a8) and [torchskeleton](https://github.com/wbaek/torchskeleton). The datasets CIFAR-10 and MNIST were used.

This repository is just a quick compilation of some of the last experiments I ran. The codes and notebooks can be a bit disorganized.
